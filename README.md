This repo contains a working hack for CS2 that features:

- Snapline, box and bone ESP with configurable colors
- Aimbot with configurable FOV and smoothing

THIS HACK IS DEPENDENT ON HAVING THE NVIDIA GEFORCE OVERLAY INSTALLED.

The code hijacks the nvidia overlay to draw the ESP, so you must have the nvidia overlay installed in order to hijack it.

Instructions:

1. Update the offsets (up to date offsets can be found on the a2x cs2-dumper page)
2. Compile the entire solution
3. Drag the .sys file on the mapper to map the driver
4. Open CS2 and start the user mode application

Enjoy!
